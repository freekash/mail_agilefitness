Dear Ishwarya,

I have given you all the details as per your request last week itself.
Kindly make the payment at once. The vendor is pressuring me for the

For just one payment how many times do we have to write mails and follows
over the phone. Kindly do the needful at the earliest.

Regards,
Arathi Clement
